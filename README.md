# Dance Battle:

We enabled our HiWonder Arms to perform a dance battle. We designed dance routines for two robotic arms equipped with external cameras. Cameras tracked the opponent arm's motion. 

Clone this repository on indivudual robotic arm's raspberry pi.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JBVAkshaya/ArmPi.git
```

Run the scripts

```bash
cd Functions
sudo python3 dance.py
```

Battle Kicks Off!!
